# **Diabteller**
## About Project

- This Application Predicts wether the user has diabetes or not based on users data
- The result will be shown to user if he or she has filled all the manadatory details in the form
- Based on the Probablity(chance of having diabetes), user will be able to see one of the following result:

  1. If Probablity is greater than 80% then result is: Alert! You seem to be at a very high risk of getting diabetes.Please seek immediate medical attention.
  2. If Probability is greater than 50% and less than 80% then result is: You are at a low risk of getting diabetes.
  3. If Probability is greater than 20% and less than 50% then result is: You currently are at low risk of being diagnosed with diabetes but it never hurts to take more care.
  4. If Probability is less than 20% then result is: All's fine! You seem to have very low chances of getting diabetes.

- Dataset used is PIMA India Dataset
- Before Training and Testing Data data cleaning is done
- 10 Machine Leaning Algorithms are used namely:
  1. K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (KNN)
  2. Gausssian Na√Øve Bayes (Gaussian NB)
  3. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  4. Adaboost
  5. Random Forest Classifier
  6. Perceptron
  7. Extra Tree Classifier
  8. Bagging
  9. Logistic regression
  10. Gradient Boost Classifier
- We Always used the highest Accuracy Machine Leaning Algorithm as our Model to test user's data and calculate final Probability
- The user's data has been saved inside csv file so that data points in dataset will increase which can give more accurate results
